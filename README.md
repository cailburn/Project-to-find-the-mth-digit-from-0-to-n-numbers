# Project-to-find-the-mth-digit-from-0-to-n-numbers
In this Project Python script first takes user defined limit n and then identify the digit present at a specific index l.Then uses nested loops and converts number to string to process each digit.As each digit is extracted and appended to the list.AAfter validating that index l is within the bound od generated sequence program prints the result.
this is a small project but I hope tthis helps others
